            These two divs are positioned next to one another using <span class="text-hilight">display: inline-block.</span> 
        </div>
        <div class="box red-box display-1">Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding. ( I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.</div>
        
        <section class="clearfix">
            <div class="box green-box display-2">
                These two are positioned using <span class="text-hilight">float: left.</span>
            </div>
            <div class="box green-box display-2">
                You can see that, even though the elements are spaced in the code, the space is not actually rendered on the page. This may not be a huge deal in these first examples, but...
            </div>

        <div class="box red-box">
            What if I want my side-by-side elements to take up the full width of the parent element? I can set the width of each to 50%, right?
        </div>
        <div class="box red-box">
            Wrong! Because, together, the two inline block elements will add up to 100% of the available width, but that soden'nt account for the space between.

        <section class="clearfix">

                If I do the same thing with floated elements...
            </div>
            <div class="box green-box display-2">
                The two elements are side-by-side just as I intended and fill the entire width of the parent (which, in this case, is the same as the width of the viewport.)
